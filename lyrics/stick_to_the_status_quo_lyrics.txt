[Zeke:]
You can bet there's nothing but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I've got a confession, my own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control

[Jocks:]
Everybody gather 'round

[Zeke:]
Well if Troy can tell his secret than I can tell mine... I bake

[Chad:]
What?

[Zeke:]
I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pan dowdy!

[Jocks:]
Not another sound

[Zeke:]
Someday I hope to make the perfect crême brûlée!

[Jocks:]
No, no, no, no...
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Martha Cox:]
Look at me and what do you see
Intelligence beyond compare
But inside I am stirring, something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share

[Brainiacs:]
Open up, dig way down deep

[Martha Cox:]
Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break!

[Brainiacs:]
Is that even legal?

[Brainiacs:]
Not another peep

[Martha:]
It's just dancing. Sometimes I think it's cooler than homework

[Brainiacs:]
No, no, no, no...
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Skater dude:]
Listen well, I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny
Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly

[Dudes & Dudettes:]
Speak your mind and you'll be heard

[Skater dude:]
Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer, then I'm coming clean! I play the cello!

[Dude 1:]
Awesome!

[Dude 2:]
What is it?

[Dude 1:]
A saw?

[Skater dude:]
No, dude, it's like a giant violin!

[Dudes & Dudettes:]
Not another word

[Dude 2:]
Do you have to wear a costume?

[Skater dude:]
Coat and tie

[Brainiacs:]
No, no, no, no...
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Jocks, Brainiacs & Dudes/Dudettes:]
Oh, no, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Sharpay:]
This is not what I want
This is not what I planned
And I just gotta say
I do not understand
Something is really

[Ryan:]
Something's not right

[Sharpay:]
...really wrong

[Sharpay & Ryan:]
And we gotta get things
Back where they belong
We can do it

[Skater dude:]
Gotta play

[Dudes & Dudettes:]
Stick with what you know

[Sharpay & Ryan:]
We can do it

[Martha Cox:]
Hip hop hooray!?

[Brainiacs:]
She has got to go

[Sharpay & Ryan:]
We can do it

[Zeke:]
Crême brûlée?

[Jocks:]
Keep your voice down low

[Jocks, Brainiacs & Dudes/Dudettes:]
Not another peep
No, not another word
No, not another sound
No

[Sharpay:]
Everybody quiet!

[Gabriella:]
Why is everybody staring at you?

[Taylor:]
Not me, you

[Gabriella:]
Because of the callbacks? I can't have people staring at me! I really can't!

No! No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

Oh, no, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Don't you stick to the status. No!
Stick to the status. No!
Stick to the status quo

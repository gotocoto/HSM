We're soarin', flying
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', so we're breakin' free

You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us, 'til we're separate hearts
But your faith, it gives me strength
Strength to believe

We're breakin' free
We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free
Oh, we're breakin' free!

Can you feel it building? Like a wave the ocean just can't control
Connected by a feelin', ooh, in our very souls (very souls)
Rising 'til it lifts us up, so everyone can see

We're breakin' free
We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free
Oh, we're breakin' free!

Runnin', climbin'
To get to the place to be all that we can be
Now's the time
So we're breakin' free
We're breakin' free (oh yeah)

More than hope, more than faith
This is truth, this is fate
And together we see it coming
More than you, more than me
Not a want, but a need
Both of us, breaking free!

Soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free (breaking free)

We're runnin', oh climbin'
To get to the place to be all that we can be
Now's the time (now's the time)
So we're breakin' free (oh we're breakin' free)

You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are

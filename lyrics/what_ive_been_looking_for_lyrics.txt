It's hard to believe that I couldn't see
You were always there beside me
Thought I was alone, with no one to hold
But you were always right beside me
This feeling's like no other
I want you to know

I've never had someone that knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before I finally found what I've been looking for

So good to be seen, so good to be heard
Don't have to say a word
For so long I was lost, so good to be found
I'm loving having you around
This feeling's like no other
I want you to know

I've never had someone that knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before I finally found what I've been looking for

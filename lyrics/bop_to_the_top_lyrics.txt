Mucho Gusto
¡Aye que fabulosa!
¡Rrrrr aye aye aye - arriba!
¿Quieres bailar?
Mirame

I believe in dreamin', shooting for the stars
Baby, to be number one you've got to raise the bar
Kicking and a scratching, grinding out my best
Anything it takes to climb the ladder of success

Work our tails off everyday
Gotta bump the competition, blow them all away

Caliente
Suave

Yeah, we're gonna bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop, hop til we drop
And start again
Zip, zap, zop, pop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove, till the music stops

Do the bop, bop, bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top
Gimme gimme, shimmy shimmy

Shake some booty and turn around
Flash a smile in their direction
Show some muscle, do the hustle

Yeah, we're gonna bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Wipe away your inhibitions
Stump, stump, stump, do the rump
And strut your stuff
Bop, bop, bop, straight to the top
Going for the glory
We'll keep stepping up and we just won't stop (stop)
Till we reach the top

Bop to the top

Start Of Something New
Get'cha Head In The Game
What I've Been Looking For
What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)
Stick To The Status Quo
When There Was Me And You
Bop To The Top
Breaking Free
We're All In This Together
I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You
Get'cha Head In The Game

Living in my own world, didn't understand
That anything can happen, when you take a chance
I never believed in what I couldn't see
I never opened my heart (oh) to all the possibilities, ooh

I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
And right here, tonight

This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart (I feel in my heart) the start of something new
Oh, yeah

Now who'd have ever thought that, mmm
We'd both be here tonight? Oh
Yeah, and the world looks so much brighter (brighter, brighter)
Oh, with you by my side (by my side)

I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
I know it for real

This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart the start of something new

I never knew that it could happen, 'till it happened to me
Oh, yeah
I didn't know it before, but now it's easy to see, oh

It's the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart

That it's the start of something new
It feels so right (so right) to be here with you, oh
And now, looking in your eyes (looking in your eyes)
I feel in my heart (feel in my heart)
The start of something new (the start of something new)
The start of something new
